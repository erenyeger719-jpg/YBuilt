# YBUILT - AI Website Builder

## Overview
YBUILT is an AI-powered website builder designed to generate complete, visually striking websites from user prompts within seconds. It targets the luxury market with a monochrome aesthetic and cinematic glass/gloss effects. The platform aims to revolutionize website creation through advanced AI generation, a sophisticated user interface, and an India-first payment experience via Razorpay.

## User Preferences
- Design aesthetic: X.AI Ã— Epic Games (cinematic, tactile, restrained)
- Color palette: Strict monochrome (black â†’ white) with extreme HDR
  - **Exception**: Library page uses blackâ†’redâ†’blue diagonal stripes per explicit user request
- Material system: Glass/gloss with specular highlights and reflections
- Payment: India-first with Razorpay (UPI, QR, netbanking, wallets, cards)
- Accessibility: Critical - WCAG AA compliance, keyboard nav, reduced motion support

## Enforcement Phase (October 14, 2025)
**Production-Enforceable Supply Chain Security**

### Enforcement Infrastructure
- **Policy-Check Workflow**: Hard enforcement (exit 1) on unsigned images, no `continue-on-error`
- **Deterministic Builds**: Uses stable git commit timestamp (`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(git log -1 --format=%ct)`)
- **Gatekeeper Constraint**: Requires `cosign.sigstore.dev/signature` annotations on deployments
- **Sigstore Policy Controller**: Complete installation guide for admission-time verification
- **Prometheus Canary Alerts**: Auto-rollback triggers with Kubernetes secret mounts (not GitHub Actions placeholders)
- **Vulnerability Pipeline**: Trivy filesystem scan + npm audit + OPA policy tests

### Files Created (Enforcement Phase)
- `k8s/gatekeeper/constraint-verify-cosign.yaml` - Gatekeeper constraint + Sigstore guide
- `.github/workflows/policy-check.yml` - CI hard enforcement workflow
- `monitoring/prometheus-canary-alerts.yaml` - Canary alerts with K8s secrets
- `IMPLEMENTATION_ENFORCE.md` - Complete enforcement report
- `PR_BODY_ENFORCE.md` - Ready-to-paste PR description

### Critical Fixes
1. **Hard Enforcement**: Removed `continue-on-error` from policy-check, now fails with exit 1 on unsigned
2. **Deterministic Builds**: Fixed SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH to use commit timestamp instead of current time
3. **K8s Secrets**: Changed Alertmanager from GitHub Actions placeholders to proper Kubernetes secret mounts

### Enforcement Status
- âœ… CI blocks unsigned images (hard fail)
- âœ… Reproducible builds are deterministic
- âœ… Gatekeeper blocks unsigned deployments
- âœ… Canary auto-rollback operational
- âœ… Complete vulnerability scanning
- ðŸ“‹ Sigstore Policy Controller ready to deploy
- ðŸ“‹ Alertmanager secrets need configuration

## MEGA PROMPT Platform 10x Hardening (October 14, 2025)
**Production-Ready Dual-Mode Signing + Comprehensive Verification**

### Core Files Hardened (3)
1. **scripts/reproducible-build.sh**
   - Fixed SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH to use git commit timestamp (fully deterministic)
   - Improved packaging logic: dist/ â†’ build/ â†’ src/ fallback
   - Fixed critical bug: corrected fallback path to prevent src/src nesting and missing metadata
   - Added deterministic tar flags: --sort=name, --mtime, --owner/--group

2. **scripts/cosign-sign-artifacts.sh**
   - Added dual-mode support: `--image` (containers) and `--artifact` (tarballs/releases)
   - Keyless OIDC signing preferred, key-based fallback (zero key management in CI)
   - Comprehensive SBOM (CycloneDX) and provenance (SLSA) attestation for both modes
   - Built-in verification with error handling

3. **.github/workflows/publish.yml**
   - Added `permissions.id-token: write` for OIDC keyless signing
   - Installed cosign via sigstore/cosign-installer@v3 (pinned v2.11.0)
   - Comprehensive verification: reproducible build â†’ SBOM â†’ provenance â†’ sign â†’ verify
   - Dry-run mode support for testing without actual signing/pushing

### Key Improvements
- **Deterministic Builds**: Same git commit â†’ identical artifact hash (supply chain verification)
- **Dual-Mode Signing**: Supports both container images and build artifacts (tarballs, releases)
- **Keyless OIDC**: Zero key management using GitHub OIDC tokens (secure by default)
- **Full Attestation**: SBOM + SLSA provenance attached to all signatures
- **Admission Control**: Gatekeeper + Sigstore Policy Controller block unsigned deployments

### Implementation Files
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLATFORM10X.md` - Complete implementation report with diffs, verification, manual steps
- `PR_BODY_PLATFORM10X.md` - PR description with acceptance checklist, testing guide, deployment steps

### Critical Fix During Review
- **Issue**: Fallback packaging in reproducible-build.sh was broken (src/src nesting, missing metadata)
- **Fix**: Removed pre-created directory, added proper destinations to copy commands
- **Verification**: âœ… PASS from architect - tarball structure now correct

### Status
- âœ… All 3 core files hardened and executable
- âœ… All Platform 10x infrastructure verified present
- âœ… DevContainer has all tools (cosign v2.2.0, OPA, Trivy, Helm, kubectl)
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation created
- âœ… Critical bug fixed and verified by architect
- ðŸ“‹ Ready for PR (git commands in IMPLEMENTATION_PLATFORM10X.md)

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The design emphasizes a luxurious, monochrome aesthetic featuring cinematic glass/gloss effects, specular highlights, and reflections. Key UI elements include a glass-striped hero, metallic text reflections, shimmer particle effects, and support for dark/light modes. Accessibility is a core focus, adhering to WCAG AA compliance, providing keyboard navigation, and supporting reduced motion.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, utilizing `shadcn/ui` for components, Framer Motion for animations, TanStack Query for data fetching, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Wouter for routing. The backend is an Express.js and TypeScript application. Data is stored in-memory using JSON files. Generated websites are stored in `public/previews/{jobId}/index.html`.

### Feature Specifications
