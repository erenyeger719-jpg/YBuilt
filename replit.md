## User Preferences
- Design aesthetic: X.AI × Epic Games (cinematic, tactile, restrained)
- Color palette: Strict monochrome (black → white) with extreme HDR
  - **Exception**: Library page uses black→red→blue diagonal stripes per explicit user request
- Material system: Glass/gloss with specular highlights and reflections
- Payment: India-first with Razorpay (UPI, QR, netbanking, wallets, cards)
- Accessibility: Critical - WCAG AA compliance, keyboard nav, reduced motion support

## Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite)
- **Components**:
  - `Hero.tsx` - Main hero with glass-striped backdrop and prompt input
  - `Header.tsx` - Fixed header with logo, Library button, payment, currency, theme toggles, profile icon
  - `PromptInput.tsx` - AI generation trigger with loading states
  - `Showcase.tsx` - 8 preview cards with modal display and thumbnails
  - `PreviewCard.tsx` - Individual preview card with hover play overlay
  - `PreviewModal.tsx` - Full-screen iframe for generated sites
  - `PaymentButton.tsx` - Razorpay checkout integration
  - `CurrencyToggle.tsx` - INR/USD switching
  - `ProfileIcon.tsx` - Circular profile button with user initials and accessible dropdown menu
  - `SignInModal.tsx` - Auth modal with email/password fields and mode toggle
  
- **Pages**:
  - `Studio.tsx` - Homepage with hero and showcase
  - `Library.tsx` - User library with forced black→red→blue diagonal theme, project grid, empty state, theme toggle
  
- **Hooks**:
  - `useGeneration.ts` - Job creation, polling, status management
  
- **Services**:
  - `mockAuth.ts` - Client-side auth service with localStorage token management
  
- **Styling**:
  - Custom glass/gloss utilities in `index.css`
  - Diagonal striped backdrop system
  - Metallic text reflections
  - Shimmer particle effects

### Backend (Express + TypeScript)
- **Routes**:
  - `POST /api/generate` - Create AI generation job
  - `GET /api/jobs/:jobId` - Poll job status
  - `GET /api/razorpay_key` - Get payment key (mock mode aware)
  - `POST /webhooks/razorpay` - Payment webhook with HMAC verification
  - `GET /api/credits/:userId` - Fetch user credits
  - `POST /api/auth/signin` - Sign in (auto-creates user in mock mode)
  - `POST /api/auth/signup` - Create new account
  - `GET /api/me` - Get current user metadata
  
- **Storage** (`server/storage.ts`):
  - In-memory storage with file persistence
  - Job management (create, get, update status)
  - User management (create, get by email, get by ID)
  - User credit tracking
  - Loads users and jobs from JSON on startup
  - Persists changes back to disk
  
- **Queue** (`server/queue.ts`):
  - Simple in-memory job queue
  - Mock worker with 2-4s delay
  - Keyword-based template selection
  - HTML generation and file writing

### Data Persistence
- `data/jobs.json` - Job queue storage
- `data/users.json` - User credits (demo user starts with 0)
- `data/payments.log` - Payment audit trail
- `public/previews/{jobId}/index.html` - Generated websites

### Mock Mode
- Fully functional without API keys
- Razorpay simulated (1.5s delay)
- AI generation simulated (2-4s delay)
- 8 template variations based on keywords

## Key Dependencies
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Express.js + TypeScript
- Framer Motion (animations)
- shadcn/ui (components)
- TanStack Query (data fetching)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Wouter (routing)
- Razorpay SDK (payments)

## Environment Variables
All optional - app runs in mock mode without them:
- `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` - Razorpay test key
- `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` - Razorpay secret
- `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook signature verification
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For future real AI (commented)
- `REDIS_URL` - For production queue (commented)

## Future Enhancements
1. Real OpenAI/Gemini integration for AI generation
2. Redis + BullMQ for production job queue
3. PostgreSQL for persistent storage (schema already defined)
4. User authentication with project history
5. Multi-page website generation
6. Export to GitHub/Zip
7. Custom branding extraction
8. Responsive preview modes
9. Cashfree/PayU secondary gateways
10. Subscription plans

## Development Notes
- Always maintain glass/gloss aesthetic consistency
- Ensure all interactions have prefers-reduced-motion fallbacks
- Keep accessibility as top priority (ARIA, keyboard, contrast)
- Test both mock mode and real integrations
- Maintain strict monochrome palette (no UI colors)

## Testing Strategy
1. **Generation Flow**: Prompt → Job → Poll → Display
2. **Payment Flow**: Click → Checkout → Webhook → Credits
3. **Accessibility**: Keyboard nav, screen reader, reduced motion
4. **Responsiveness**: Mobile to 4K displays
5. **Dark/Light Modes**: All components adapt correctly

## Known Issues
- Console contains validateDOMNesting accessibility warnings (non-blocking, cosmetic)
- Razorpay script loads on every mount (could be optimized)
- Preview iframe occasionally shows 404 immediately after generation (timing issue with mock worker file writing)
- Toast notifications are ephemeral and difficult to assert in automated tests

## Run Instructions
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# App available at http://localhost:5000
```

## Replit Deployment
1. Import repo
2. Click "Run"
3. Auto-deploys to `.replit.app` domain
4. Add secrets in Secrets panel for production mode
5. Webhooks auto-configured
