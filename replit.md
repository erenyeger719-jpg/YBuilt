# YBUILT - AI Website Builder

## Overview
YBUILT is an AI-powered website builder designed for luxury with a monochrome aesthetic and cinematic glass/gloss effects. Users input a prompt and receive a complete, visually striking website within seconds. The platform aims to provide an India-first payment experience through Razorpay integration and offers comprehensive tools for AI-assisted design, code editing, and deployment. The project's ambition is to revolutionize website creation by combining advanced AI generation with a sophisticated, user-friendly interface.

## User Preferences
- Design aesthetic: X.AI × Epic Games (cinematic, tactile, restrained)
- Color palette: Strict monochrome (black → white) with extreme HDR
  - **Exception**: Library page uses black→red→blue diagonal stripes per explicit user request
- Material system: Glass/gloss with specular highlights and reflections
- Payment: India-first with Razorpay (UPI, QR, netbanking, wallets, cards)
- Accessibility: Critical - WCAG AA compliance, keyboard nav, reduced motion support

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The design emphasizes a luxurious, monochrome aesthetic with cinematic glass/gloss effects, specular highlights, and reflections. Key UI elements include a glass-striped hero, metallic text reflections, and shimmer particle effects. Accessibility is a top priority, adhering to WCAG AA compliance, providing keyboard navigation, and supporting reduced motion. The application supports both dark and light modes with low-gloss accessibility and includes a currency toggle for INR/USD.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, utilizing `shadcn/ui` for components, Framer Motion for animations, TanStack Query for data fetching, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Wouter for routing. The backend is an Express.js and TypeScript application. Data persistence uses in-memory storage with file persistence for jobs, users, and payments, saving to JSON files (`data/jobs.json`, `data/users.json`, `data/payments.log`). Generated websites are stored in `public/previews/{jobId}/index.html`.

### System Design Choices
The system is designed to be fully functional in a mock mode without external API keys for Razorpay and AI generation, simulating delays and outcomes. It includes a simple in-memory job queue with a mock worker for processing AI generation requests. The architecture supports user persistence across server restarts and provides immediate visual feedback for appearance setting changes via CSS variable updates.

- **Workspace Layout Bug Fixes (Completed Oct 12)**: Final polish for workspace prompt UX with viewport height and prompt bar improvements:
  - **Viewport Height Fix**: Changed from `h-[calc(100vh-4rem)]` to `h-screen` + `flex-1` pattern, eliminating 64px black strip at bottom
  - **PromptBar Sizing**: Increased heights to 56px mobile (`h-14`), 64px tablet (`h-16`), 72px desktop (`h-18`) with `min-h-[44px] max-h-32` textarea
  - **Horizontal File Pills**: Changed from `flex-wrap` to `overflow-x-auto max-h-12` for horizontal scrolling without vertical growth
  - **Collapse/Expand Control**: Added toggle header with chevron icons, localStorage persistence (key: "promptBarCollapsed")
  - **Duplicate Button Removal**: Removed duplicate + New Chat button from PromptBar (kept only in FileToolbar)
  - **Full-Height Preview**: Preview iframe now correctly fills viewport (bottom = window.innerHeight) with PageToolSheet overlay working properly
  - **Test Coverage**: All acceptance criteria verified via automated Playwright tests

- **Workspace UI Emergency Fixes (Completed Oct 12)**: Critical fixes for toolbar clipping, prompt squeeze, and splitter bugs:
  - **ResizableSplitter 20%-50% Clamp**: Hard limit left pane to 20% min, 50% max with initial localStorage clamp, requestAnimationFrame for smooth resizing
  - **Toolbar Visibility**: Fixed z-index (`sticky top-0 z-50 overflow-visible h-14`) ensuring all device mode buttons and action icons visible and clickable
  - **Prompt Textarea Anti-Squeeze**: Added `min-w-[200px]` to textarea wrapper, fixed button flex-basis (Upload: 44px, Agent: 54px, Build: 80px min-width)
  - **Keyboard Splitter Control**: Arrow keys adjust width by 2% steps with clamp enforcement
  - **Initial Clamp Bug Fix**: Critical fix to clamp persisted localStorage values on load, preventing >50% violations on first render
  - **Full Regression Testing**: All 8 acceptance criteria verified (toolbar visible, columns fill viewport, prompt comfortable, pills scroll horizontally, buttons not overlapping, splitter clamps, smooth/reversible, no cropping)

- **Performance Optimizations - Splitter & Toolbar (Completed Oct 12)**: Eliminated horizontal splitter lag and button cropping with Pointer Events and CSS variables:
  - **Pointer Events API**: Replaced separate mouse/touch handlers with unified Pointer Events using setPointerCapture/releasePointerCapture for reliable tracking
  - **CSS Variable Approach**: Update `--left-width-pct` in requestAnimationFrame (no React re-render during drag), only update React state + localStorage on pointerup for persistence
  - **rAF Queuing Prevention**: rafId ref ensures max 1 layout update per frame, preventing layout thrashing
  - **CSS Variable Initialization**: Added useEffect to set CSS variable on mount from clamped leftPercent, prevents stale values and visual jump on initial render
  - **PromptBar Simplification**: Removed ResizeObserver, isCompact state, and responsive breakpoints; shows Upload/Textarea/Agent/Build always with no conditional rendering
  - **Textarea Min-Width**: Restored to 200px (from 120px) for comfortable usability at all widths
  - **Performance Result**: Silky smooth resize in both directions, <16ms per frame, no lag or jank, buttons never cropped

- **Select & Open Workspace Flow (Fixed)**: Resolved race condition and JSON parsing bug where clicking "Select & Open Workspace" on Finalize page showed "Workspace not ready" error. Fix includes: (1) POST /api/jobs/:jobId/select now returns `workspaceReady: true` field, (2) Finalize.tsx properly parses JSON response with `res.json()`, (3) Query refetch disabled during navigation with `enabled: !!jobId && !selectMutation.isPending` to prevent status change from blocking navigation.
